# Sinking Fund Platform

A collaborative savings and loan platform where groups pool money together through bi-weekly contributions, members can borrow against pooled funds with interest, and active members receive proportional interest share at year-end.

---

## What is a Sinking Fund?

A sinking fund is a **collaborative savings system** (known in the Philippines as "paluwagan") where:

- Members pool their money through regular bi-weekly contributions
- Members can borrow against pooled money with co-maker support
- Loans accrue interest (5% for members, 10% for non-members)
- Active members share interest earned from loans at year-end
- Everyone gets their contributions back (plus interest share if active)

**Perfect for:**
- Groups of friends, family, or colleagues
- Building financial discipline together
- Accessing low-interest loans
- Earning interest through collective savings

## Business Rules Summary

### Loan Eligibility

| Time in Group | Maximum Loan |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Less than 6 months** | MIN(Monthly Contribution, 50% of Avg Annual Savings) |
| **6 months or more** | MAX(Monthly Contribution, 50% of Avg Annual Savings) |

**Where:**
- Monthly Contribution = Bi-weekly × 2
- Avg Annual Savings = (Total Contributions ÷ Active Months) × 12

### Co-Maker Rules
- Required for loans > monthly contribution amount
- Co-maker cannot have active loans
- Co-maker blocked from borrowing until loan is repaid
- Co-maker jointly liable for repayment

### Interest Rates
- **Members**: 5% per month (configurable per group)
- **Non-Members**: 10% per month (configurable per group)
- Fixed term: 2 months

### Repayment Rules
- Can pay fully or partially
- Partial payments split proportionally (principal + interest)
- Example: ₱55,000 total (₱50K + ₱5K interest), pay ₱20,000 → ₱18,182 principal + ₱1,818 interest

### Missed Payments
- **Grace Period**: 7 days after scheduled date
- After grace period → Marked as missed, increment consecutive counter
- **3 Consecutive Missed** → Set inactive (no interest share)
- Payment made → Reset counter to 0

### Loan Defaults
- After 2 months past due → Mark as DEFAULTED
- Notify borrower and admin via email + in-app
- Disable borrower's future loans
- Co-maker remains jointly liable

### Year-End Distribution
- **Active Members**: Contributions + Proportional interest share
- **Inactive Members**: Contributions only (no interest)
- Interest Share = (Member Contributions ÷ Total Pool) × Total Interest Earned
- Distribution Date: December 20-24 (configurable per group)

## Core Business Logic

### Loan Eligibility Calculator
```typescript
function calculateMaxLoanAmount(member: GroupMember, group: Group): LoanEligibility {
  const monthlyContribution = member.biWeeklyContribution * 2
  const activeMonths = getMonthsActive(member.joinedAt)
  
  const totalContributions = member.totalContributions
  const avgAnnualSavings = (totalContributions / activeMonths) * 12
  
  const option1 = monthlyContribution
  const option2 = avgAnnualSavings * (group.maxLoanPercent / 100)
  
  // Rule: <6 months = MIN, >=6 months = MAX
  const maxLoan = activeMonths < 6 
    ? Math.min(option1, option2) 
    : Math.max(option1, option2)
  
  return { maxLoan, monthlyContribution, avgAnnualSavings, activeMonths }
}
```

### Proportional Repayment Calculator
```typescript
function calculateRepayment(loan: Loan, paymentAmount: Float): RepaymentSplit {
  const remainingTotal = (loan.amount + loan.totalInterest) - loan.repaidAmount
  const effectivePayment = Math.min(paymentAmount, remainingTotal)
  
  // Proportional split
  const totalDue = loan.amount + loan.totalInterest
  const ratio = effectivePayment / totalDue
  
  const principal = loan.amount * ratio
  const interest = loan.totalInterest * ratio
  
  return { principal, interest, total: effectivePayment }
}
```

### Interest Distribution Calculator
```typescript
function calculateYearEndDistribution(group: Group): MemberDistribution[] {
  const totalPool = sum(group.contributions, 'amount')
  const totalInterestEarned = sum(group.loans.filter(l => l.status === 'REPAID'), 'totalInterest')
  
  return group.members.map(member => {
    const memberContributions = sum(member.contributions, 'amount')
    
    if (!member.isActive) {
      // Inactive: only return contributions
      return {
        memberId: member.id,
        contributionAmount: memberContributions,
        interestShare: 0,
        totalPayout: memberContributions
      }
    }
    
    // Active: proportional interest share
    const contributionPercent = memberContributions / totalPool
    const interestShare = totalInterestEarned * contributionPercent
    
    return {
      memberId: member.id,
      contributionAmount: memberContributions,
      interestShare,
      totalPayout: memberContributions + interestShare
    }
  })
}
```
