## What is a Sinking Fund?

A sinking fund is a **collaborative savings and loan system** where:

- Members pool their money together through regular contributions
- Members can borrow against the pooled money with interest
- Interest earned from loans is distributed among active members
- Everyone gets their money back (plus interest share) at year-end

**Why join?**
- ✅ Save money consistently through bi-weekly contributions
- ✅ Access to low-interest loans (5% vs. banks)
- ✅ Earn interest from the pool when others borrow
- ✅ Build financial discipline and community trust

---

## How It Works

### The Cycle
1. **Join a group** - Set your bi-weekly contribution amount
2. **Contribute regularly** - Every payday, add money to the pool
3. **Borrow when needed** - Apply for loans with co-maker support
4. **Repay on time** - 2-month term with affordable installments
5. **Earn interest** - Active members share interest from loans
6. **Year-end payout** - Get your contributions + interest share

### Example Timeline

```
January 2025 - Join group, set ₱2,000 bi-weekly contribution
January-December 2025 - Make 26 bi-weekly contributions (₱52,000 total)
March 2025 - Borrow ₱30,000 (with co-maker), repay ₱33,000 in 2 months
June 2025 - Borrow ₱20,000, repay ₱22,000 in 2 months
December 2025 - Receive ₱52,000 + interest share (if active)
```

## Contribution Rules

### Setting Your Contribution

**Bi-Weekly Contributions:**
- Fixed amount you contribute every 2 weeks
- Amount is set when you join and cannot be changed mid-term
- Personal schedule based on your payday (e.g., every 15th and 30th)

**Example:**
```
Monthly income: ₱20,000
Bi-weekly contribution: ₱2,000 (10% of income)
Total per month: ₱4,000
Total per year: ₱52,000
```

### Payment Schedule

**Automatic Schedule:**
- System generates contribution dates based on your payday
- Example: Payday on 15th → Contributions on 15th and 29th of each month
- Runs from group start date to year-end date

### Making Contributions

**How to pay:**
1. Go to group dashboard
2. View your scheduled contributions
3. Mark contribution as "Paid" on your payday
4. Optional: Add note (e.g., "Paycheck deposit")

### Grace Period

**1-Week Grace Period:**
- After scheduled date, you have 7 days to mark as paid
- Grace period configurable by group admin
- If not paid within grace period → **Marked as missed**

### Missed Payments

**Consequence:**
1. Payment marked as "missed"
2. Consecutive missed counter increases
3. After 3 consecutive missed payments → **Become inactive**
4. Inactive members get **no interest share** at year-end

**Example:**
```
Scheduled: January 15
Grace period ends: January 22
Not paid by January 22 → Missed payment (1/3)
Missed next payment → Missed (2/3)
Missed 3rd payment → Becomes INACTIVE
No interest share at year-end
```

**Recovery:**
- Make payment → Reset missed counter to 0
- Before 3 misses → Remain eligible for interest

---

## Loan Rules

### Who Can Borrow

**Official Members:**
- Must be in group for at least 1 contribution cycle
- Must be active (no 3+ consecutive missed payments)
- Must meet eligibility requirements

**Non-Members:**
- Can borrow if official member serves as co-maker
- Co-maker is jointly responsible for repayment
- No contribution requirement

### Loan Eligibility Calculation

Your maximum loan amount depends on:

1. **Monthly Contribution**
   - Your bi-weekly amount × 2
   - Example: ₱2,000 bi-weekly → ₱4,000 monthly

2. **Average Annual Savings**
   - (Total contributions ÷ Active months) × 12
   - Example: ₱52,000 over 6 months → ₱104,000 average annual

**Eligibility Rules:**

| Time in Group | Maximum Loan |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Less than 6 months** | MIN(Monthly Contribution, 50% of Avg Annual Savings) |
| **6 months or more** | MAX(Monthly Contribution, 50% of Avg Annual Savings) |

**Examples:**

```
Scenario 1: New Member (3 months active)
- Bi-weekly: ₱2,000 → Monthly: ₱4,000
- Total contributed: ₱24,000 → Avg annual: ₱96,000
- 50% of avg annual: ₱48,000
- MAX LOAN = MIN(₱4,000, ₱48,000) = ₱4,000

Scenario 2: Long-term Member (12 months active)
- Bi-weekly: ₱5,000 → Monthly: ₱10,000
- Total contributed: ₱260,000 → Avg annual: ₱260,000
- 50% of avg annual: ₱130,000
- MAX LOAN = MAX(₱10,000, ₱130,000) = ₱130,000
```

### Loan Application Process

**Step 1: Check Eligibility**
- View your maximum eligible amount
- See breakdown of how it was calculated
- Ensure you have no active loans

**Step 2: Request Loan**
- Enter loan amount (cannot exceed max eligible)
- Select co-maker if borrowing > monthly contribution
- For non-members: Enter borrower name (you become co-maker)

**Step 3: Admin Review**
- Loan status: "Pending"
- Admin reviews eligibility and co-maker status
- Admin approves or rejects

**Step 4: Loan Activation**
- Upon approval: Status changes to "Active"

### Interest Rates

| Borrower Type | Monthly Interest | 2-Month Interest |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Official Member** | 5% | 10% total |
| **Non-Member** | 10% | 20% total |

**Examples:**

```
Member borrows ₱50,000:
- Monthly interest: 5% × ₱50,000 = ₱2,500
- 2-month interest: ₱2,500 × 2 = ₱5,000
- Total due: ₱55,000

Non-member borrows ₱50,000:
- Monthly interest: 10% × ₱50,000 = ₱5,000
- 2-month interest: ₱5,000 × 2 = ₱10,000
- Total due: ₱60,000
```

### Loan Limits & Cap

**Group-Level Cap:**
- Maximum: 50% of borrower's average annual savings
- Prevents over-borrowing beyond contribution capacity
- Configurable by group admin

**Individual Limit:**
- Members with active loans cannot borrow again

**During Loan Term:**
- Cannot borrow money yourself
- Monitor repayment status
- Remain accountable to group

**If Borrower Defaults:**
- You become primary debtor
- Must repay the loan
- Your credit standing in group affected
- Cannot borrow until repaid

### Selecting a Co-Maker

**Eligibility Requirements:**

---

## Repayment Rules

### Repayment Terms

**Fixed Term:**
- 2 months from approval date
- No extensions allowed (unless group admin decides)
- Strict due date enforcement

**Repayment Options:**
1. **Full Payment** - Pay entire amount at once
2. **Partial Payments** - Pay in multiple installments

### How Repayments Work

**Partial Payments:**
- Split proportionally between principal and interest
- Reduces total due by payment amount
- Continued until fully repaid

**Example:**
```
Loan: ₱50,000 principal + ₱5,000 interest = ₱55,000 total

Payment 1: ₱20,000
- Principal: (₱50,000 ÷ ₱55,000) × ₱20,000 = ₱18,182
- Interest: (₱5,000 ÷ ₱55,000) × ₱20,000 = ₱1,818
- Remaining: ₱55,000 - ₱20,000 = ₱35,000

Payment 2: ₱35,000
- Principal: (₱50,000 ÷ ₱55,000) × ₱35,000 = ₱31,818
- Interest: (₱5,000 ÷ ₱55,000) × ₱35,000 = ₱3,182
- Loan fully repaid
```

### Repayment Schedule

**Making Payments:**
1. Go to loan detail page
2. Enter payment amount
3. See split between principal and interest
4. Submit payment

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Can I belong to multiple sinking fund groups?**
A: Yes, but each group is independent. You must manage contributions and loans separately.

**Q: What happens if the group has no borrowers?**
A: No interest is earned. Active members still get their contributions back at year-end.

**Q: Can I change my contribution amount mid-term?**
A: No, contribution amounts are fixed for the term. Changes can only be made at year-end for the next term.

**Q: What if I don't need to borrow?**
A: That's fine! You'll still earn interest from other members' loans. Being a steady contributor increases your interest share.

### Loan Questions

**Q: Can I borrow more than once per term?**
A: Yes, but only if your previous loan is fully repaid. You cannot have multiple active loans simultaneously.

**Q: What if I can't repay on time?**
A: Contact admin immediately. They may work out a plan. After 2 months without payment, your loan defaults and co-maker becomes liable.

**Q: Can I repay early?**
A: Yes! You can make partial payments anytime or pay in full early. The interest remains fixed.

**Q: What if I can't find a co-maker?**
A: You can only borrow up to your monthly contribution without a co-maker. Otherwise, wait until someone else is available or borrow less.

### Contribution Questions

**Q: What if I get paid on different dates each month?**
A: Set your payday to the most consistent date. If payday varies, mark contributions as paid on the actual payment day.

**Q: Can I contribute extra?**
A: Yes! Extra contributions increase your total pool share and potential interest earnings. They'll be added to your contribution total.

**Q: What happens if I forget to mark a contribution as paid?**
A: Contact admin to mark it for you. They can verify payments manually if needed.

### Interest & Distribution Questions

**Q: How is interest calculated on loans?**
A: Simple monthly interest: Principal × Interest Rate × Months. No compound interest.

**Q: Do I earn interest on my contributions?**
A: No direct interest. You earn a share of interest collected from loans to other members, based on your contribution percentage.

**Q: What if a borrower defaults on a loan?**
A: The co-maker becomes liable. The principal and interest are still collected (from co-maker), so it contributes to the interest pool for distribution.

**Q: Can I see how much interest I'll earn at year-end?**
A: Yes! The system provides estimates based on current loan activity and your contribution percentage.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. All data is encrypted, and only group members can see group information. Financial data is visible only to relevant parties.

**Q: What if the system is down on my payday?**
A: Mark as paid when it's back up. The system tracks scheduled dates, not exact payment timestamps.

**Q: Can I export my contribution history?**
A: Yes, detailed records are available for download (PDF/CSV) for your records.
